Roles are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. In this step I created some individual roles. One of those roles was named "Supreme Admin." This specific role has access to crate tickets, delete tickets, etc. In order to do this , you must start in the "Admin panel," then "Agents" tab, and soon afrer click on "Roles" snd from there you can create the specific permissions/task per organization.

In this step I crated SLA or Service Level Agreements for the timeframe of this specific ticket is required to be closed. This action was completed by setting priorities for each ticket.

In this step, a ticket was created and worked on as an in user. I was able to set some ticket properties and work a few tickets as a helpdesk professional.
